Installing PlugData is very simple, but below I've listed the recommended method for each platform. If you are upgrading from an older version, read the release description carefully: sometimes upgrading requires a bit of extra work. Going into the future, I hope this won't be necessary anymore.

## Mac
Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/timothyschoen/PlugData/releases/) page. Scroll down and click "Assets", choose the MacOS Universal version. This should run on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Windows
Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/timothyschoen/PlugData/releases/) page. Scroll down and click "Assets", choose the 32-bit or 64-bit Windows version version. Windows might show a warning, saying that the file is not trusted. If you can install it anyway, it should be fine. If Windows Defender prevents you from installing, there is also a zip package with plugins, available without installer: see the "PluginsAndExecutable.zip" file.

## Linux
For Linux users, I'd recommend using the OBS packages for most distros, or the AUR package on Arch.
OBS packages (maintained by @KottV): https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Aplugdata&package=plugdata
AUR packages (maintained by @aik2mlj): https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plugdata-git

If your distro is not supported, see [Building from Source](Building-from-Source).


## Latest build
Windows, Mac and Linux users with a Github account can download the latest (unstable/untested) build from the [Actions](https://github.com/timothyschoen/PlugData/actions) page.
